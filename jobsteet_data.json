The demand for such service by PAGCOR prompted to outsource a third-party auditor to provide PAGCOR a modular yet centralized system to manage gaming license holders, outlets, terminals, cashiers, operations, and players. The introduction of automated auditing is an impeccable chance for MegaXcess IT Solutions, Inc and PAGCOR to cater the needs of our local e-gaming operators and licensees. This system will allow PAGCOR to have an intermediation platform to conduct real time audit for any gaming licensee at any time. Payment solutions are integrated into the system so that PAGCOR will be able to make precise collections of the required fees, penalties and revenues from outlet operators based on accurate system generated audit reports. We aim to provide necessary support essential for the growth of the Licensee and the Philippine gaming industry. With our state-of-the-art technology, MegaXcess aims to integrate an automated auditing system to ensure transparency from the operators to PAGCOR, and everything in between. Our goal is to help the gaming industry through efficient and transparent auditing that will increase the PAGCOR\u2019s gaming revenue. The government can highly benefit from growing industry and use its revenue to help develop the country. If done correctly, the Philippines will become a striking investment center for other online businesses and different industries."
